# Raw Data

This directory is reserved for storing original, unmodified data files used by the project.

The physics reasoning engine does not require any external datasets, so this folder remains empty in the repository. It is included to maintain a standard, research-friendly project structure and to support future extensions that may involve raw data collection.

Any raw input files (if added later) should be placed here before processing.
